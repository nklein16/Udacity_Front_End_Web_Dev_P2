## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

### Nathaniel's Notes - About the Game

This is a Memory Game.  There are 16 cards turned face down. Click on cards to try to flipo them over and try to match them.  If there is no match, the cards will flip face-down; if there is a match, the cards will change color, become unclickable, and remain face-up.  The timer starts once the second card has been clicked. There are four gold stars.  For every fourth non-match of cards, a star will be lost. One can win the game by matching all the cards or lose by having no remaining stars prior to completing the game.
